    <h1>Cassava Bacterial Blight Disease: Prevention and control</h1>
    <div class="one column">
    Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis is capable of infecting most members of the
    plant genus Manihot. Consisting of about 100 species, the most economically
    significant species is easily the widely cultivated woody shrub, Manihot
    esculenta, <span class="s1">known colloquially as the cassava plant. In cassava, symptoms
    vary in a manner that is unique to this pathogen.(www.wikipedia.org)
    Symptoms include blight, wilting, dieback, and vascular necrosis. A more
    diagnostic symptom visible in cassava with X. axonopodis infection is angular
    necrotic spotting of the leaves—often with a chlorotic ring encircling the
    spots. These spots begin as distinguishable moist,</span> brown lesions normally
    restricted to the bottom of the plant until they enlarge and coalesce—often
    killing the entire leaf. A further diagnostic symptom often embodies itself as
    pools of gum exudate along wounds and leaf cross veins. It begins as a sappy
    golden liquid and hardens to form an amber coloured deposit. (www.wikipedia.org)

    PREVENTION AND CONTROL
    Use Resistant Varieties
    In areas where the CBB is endemic, farmers must use CBB resistance varieties if
    they are to realize sustainable yields.

    Roguing of Plants
    Farmers cultivating susceptible varieties must regularly search and destroy the
    plants showing symptoms of the disease by burning them. This activity must follow the first few incidents of rains after the dry season. Early detection and destruction, can prevent or reduce the rate of spread of disease on the farm.

    It is, however, safe to eat tubers of CBB infected plants.

    Practise Land Fallow
    In cases of an outbreak on the whole farm, farmers must harvest roots
    immediately <span>and destroy the whole plants (stem, leaves, etc) by burning. They
    may also plough them deep into the soil. Leave the land to fallow for a minimum
    of 3 years in both cases. The bacterium for CBB is not able to survive outside
    the host for long periods.</span>

    Practise Crop Rotation
    In areas where land is scarce, farmers may plant legumes and grains on the
    </div>
    <div class="column">
    same
    land after the destruction of infected plants. The farmer may return after 3
    seasons to grow cassava.

    Apply Quarantine Measures
    Authorities must monitor the movement of materials across borders to ensure the
    safety with respect to diseases. This will prevent the introduction of diseases
    to new areas.
    <span class="s2">
    Use of Healthy Planting Material
    Farmers must consciously harvest stems from healthy plants completely free of
    any of the described symptoms of the disease. It is generally wise to avoid
    using planting materials from any farm suspected to be under CBB attack even
    if symptoms of the disease have not been observed on plants.</span>

    Control Pest
    Grasshoppers and other insects that can serve as carriers of the bacterium
    from farm to farm must be controlled using environmentally friendly measures.
    Controlling grasshopper movement after the early first rains of the wet season
    can reduce the spread of Cassava Bacterial Blight.
