    <p>The Bengal is a domestic cat breed developed to look like exotic jungle cats
    such as leopards, ocelots, margays and clouded leopards. Bengal cats were
    developed by selective breeding from hybrids of the Asian leopard cat (ALC),
    Prionailurus bengalensis bengalensis, with domestic cat, backcrossed to
    domestic cats, with the goal of creating a confident, healthy, and friendly
    cat with a highly contrasted and vividly marked coat.[1]
    The name <span>"Bengal cat" was derived from the taxonomic name of the Asian leopard
    cat (P. b. bengalensis). They have a "wild" appearance with large spots/
    rosettes/arrowheads, and a light/white belly, and a body structure
    reminiscent of the ALC.[2] Bengals are an intelligent and active breed, and
    are known for being especially vocal and friendly. [3]</span>Once separated by at
    least four generations from the original ALC × domestic cat crossing,
    the breed's temperament resembles that of a domestic cat.[2]
    Bengal cats are generally a bright orange to light brown colour, although
    pale or off-white "snow" Bengals also exist, and are popular among owners.[4]</p>

    <p>A tabby is any domestic cat (Felis catus) that has a coat featuring distinctive
    stripes, dots, lines or swirling patterns, usually together with a mark
    resembling an 'M' on its forehead. Tabbies are sometimes erroneously assumed
    to be a cat breed.[1] In fact, the tabby pattern is found in many breeds,
    and is a genetic landrace common among the general mixed-breed population.
    The tabby pattern is a naturally occurring feature that may be related to
    the coloration of the domestic cat's direct ancestor, the African wildcat
    (Felis lybica lybica), which — along with the European wildcat
    (Felis silvestris silvestris) and Asiatic wildcat (Felis lybica ornata) — has
    a similar coloration. A genetic study found five genetic clusters from
    tabbies to be ancestral to wildcats of various parts of the world.[2]</p>

    <p>The Persian cat (Persian: گربه ایرانی Gorbe Irâni) is a long-haired breed of
    cat characterized by its round face and short muzzle. It is also known as
    the Persian Longhair in the English-speaking countries. In the Middle East
    region they are widely known as Iranian cat and in Iran they are known as
    Shirazi cat. The first documented ancestors of the Persian were imported into
    Italy from Iran (historically known as Persia) around 1620.[1] The exact
    history of the Persian cat does seem to be a bit of a mystery but many of
    these long-haired cats were seen in hieroglyphics. The story has it that
    these long-haired cats were then imported into Europe as their popularity
    grew and breeding took place in
    Italy and France. In 2015 it was ranked as the 2nd most popular breed in the
    United States according to the Cat Fanciers' Association.[4] The first is
    the Exotic breed.</p>

    <p>The Chow Chow is a sturdily built dog, square in profile, with a broad skull
    and small, triangular, erect ears with rounded tips. The breed is known for
    a very dense double coat that is either smooth or rough.[1]:4–5 The fur is
    particularly thick in the neck area, giving it a distinctive ruff or mane
    appearance. The coat may be shaded/self-red, black, blue, cinnamon/fawn,
    or cream.[1]:4–5[9] Not all these color varieties are recognized as valid
    in all countries. Individuals with patchy or multicolored coats are
    considered to be outside the breed standard. Chow Chow eyes are typically
    deep set and almond shaped. The breed is distinguished by its unusual
    blue-black/purple tongue and very straight hind legs, resulting in a rather
    stilted gait.[1]:4–5 The bluish color extends to the Chow Chow's lips; this
    is the only dog breed with this distinctive bluish color in its lips and
    oral cavity (other dogs have black or a piebald pattern skin in their
    mouths).[1]:4–5 One other distinctive feature is the curly tail.[1]:4–5
    It has thick hair and lies curled on its back. The nose should be black,
    but blue-coated Chow Chow can have a solid blue or slate-colored nose.
    According to the American Kennel Club breed standards, any other tone is
    not acceptable for contests.[10] FCI countries, however, do allow a
    self-colored nose in the cream.[11]</p>
